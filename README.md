# DevOps Projects Portfolio
A comprehensive collection of DevOps-related projects


Welcome to My DevOps Projects Portfolio!

The three C's of DevOps I love and capture the essence of this beautiful way of working are
* Culture
* Communication
* Collaboration

I have been in this area of industry for 13 years now. I love everything about it and some. I am also a writer. So, a decade and some years later, I have put two of my passions together.

This repository is a curated collection of diverse DevOps projects, demonstrating a wide range of skills and practices in the field. It includes examples and implementations across automation, cloud infrastructure, CI/CD pipelines, monitoring, and disaster recovery strategies.

## Topics Overview (I will add more as I go)
	Below are a few projects I am working on. I will add more details and code as I make progress.

###Disaster Recovery and High Availability in Cloud: Strategies and implementations for ensuring high availability and disaster recovery in cloud environments.
Infrastructure As Code-Terraform: Use cases of Terraform for automating cloud infrastructure provisioning.
CI/CD Pipeline Integration: Demonstrations on setting up and optimizing CI/CD pipelines for efficient software delivery. I am planning to get examples from widely used tools and tech.

### Monitoring and Alerting Solutions: Projects on setting up monitoring and alerting frameworks for proactive incident management. ( With examples from widely used tools and tech)

### Cloud migrations: Cloud migration is moving digital business operations into the cloud. It involves transferring data, applications, and IT processes from some or all of an organization's existing on-premises infrastructure to a cloud environment. This transition aims to improve scalability, flexibility, and accessibility while potentially reducing costs and enhancing disaster recovery capabilities.

### Containerization: Containerization is a lightweight alternative to full machine virtualization that involves encapsulating an application in a container with its operating environment. This provides a consistent and isolated application environment, improving scalability and efficiency.

### Scripting: In DevOps, scripting refers to writing short programs or scripts to automate software installation, configuration, and updates. Scripting enhances efficiency and reduces the likelihood of human error in repetitive tasks.

### DevOps Best Practices: DevOps best practices include continuous integration and delivery, automation of the software development lifecycle, monitoring and logging, collaboration and communication among teams, and a focus on continuous improvement to enhance software quality and delivery speed.

##P urpose
This portfolio aims to showcase practical DevOps skills, share knowledge with the community, and inspire innovation through collaborative contributions.

## Contributions
Contributions, feedback, and discussions are highly encouraged. Feel free to engage by opening issues or submitting pull requests to propose improvements or discuss potential collaborations.

Thank you for exploring this portfolio.
Let's learn, experiment, and drive the future of DevOps together!
